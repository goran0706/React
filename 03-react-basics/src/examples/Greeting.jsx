  The best part of hooks is that if you find a bit of logic inside your component
  function that you think would be useful elsewhere, you can put that in another
  function and call it from the components that need it (just like regular
  JavaScript). These functions you create are called "custom hooks".

  Create a custom hook called `useLocalStorageState` for reusability of all this
  logic.

      ðŸ’¯ lazy state initialization
      Right now, every time our component function is run, our function reads from
      localStorage. This is problematic because it could be a performance bottleneck
      (reading from localStorage can be slow). And what's more we only actually need
      to know the value from localStorage the first time this component is rendered!
      So the additional reads are wasted effort.

      To avoid this problem, React's useState hook allows you to pass a function
      instead of the actual value, and then it will only call that function to get the
      state value when the component is rendered the first time. So you can go from
      this: `React.useState(someExpensiveComputation())` To this:
      `React.useState(() => someExpensiveComputation())`

      And the `someExpensiveComputation` function will only be called when it's
      needed!

      Make the `React.useState` call use lazy initialization to avoid a performance
      bottleneck of reading into localStorage on every render.

  /**
    The callback we're passing to `React.useEffect` is called after _every_ render
    of our component (including re-renders). This is exactly what we want because we
    want to make sure that the `name` is saved into localStorage whenever it
    changes, but there are various reasons a component can be re-rendered (for
    example, when a parent component in the application tree gets re-rendered).

    Really, we _only_ want localStorage to get updated when the `name` state
    actually changes. It doesn't need to re-run any other time. Luckily for us,
    `React.useEffect` allows you to pass a second argument called the "dependency
    array" which signals to React that your effect callback function should be
    called when (and only when) those dependencies change. So we can use this to
    avoid doing unnecessary work!

    Add a dependencies array for `React.useEffect` to avoid the callback being
    called too frequently.
